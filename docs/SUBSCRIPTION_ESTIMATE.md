## 💡 Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I try SyncLedger before committing?
**A**: Yes! We offer a 14-day free trial with full access to Professional plan features (up to 200 invoices). Contact us to get started.

### Q: How does the AI Vision extraction work?
**A**: Every invoice PDF is converted to a high-resolution image and sent to OpenAI's GPT-4o Vision model. The AI "reads" the invoice like a human — understanding layouts, tables, headers, and context. It returns structured JSON data with 97%+ accuracy, regardless of the vendor format. This works on scanned PDFs, digital PDFs, handwritten notes, and multi-language documents.

### Q: What happens if I exceed my plan's invoice limit?
**A**: Your invoices continue processing without interruption. Additional invoices beyond your plan limit are billed at the overage rate for your tier ($0.08–$0.15 per invoice). You receive automated alerts at 80% and 100% of your limit. Overages are billed on the 1st of the following month. If you're consistently over, we recommend upgrading to the next plan tier.

### Q: Are there any hidden fees beyond the subscription?
**A**: No hidden fees. Your subscription includes all AI processing, infrastructure, storage, and support within your plan limits. The only additional costs are: (1) invoice overages if you exceed your limit, (2) optional add-ons you choose to enable, and (3) third-party services (Microsoft 365, Sage) billed directly by those providers.

### Q: What third-party services do I need to pay for separately?
**A**: You'll need:
- **Microsoft 365 email license** (~$6-12/mailbox/month) — billed by Microsoft
- **Sage accounting system** (your existing subscription)
- That's it! AI processing is fully included.

### Q: Is my data secure?
**A**: Absolutely. We use bank-level encryption (AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit), server-side refresh token session management, role-based access control, and follow industry best practices. Invoice images sent to GPT-4o are processed in real-time and not stored by OpenAI.

### Q: Can I cancel anytime?
**A**: Monthly subscriptions can be cancelled with 30 days notice. Annual subscriptions have a 12-month commitment. Your data is available for export for 90 days after cancellation.

### Q: What accuracy can I expect?
**A**: GPT-4o Vision AI achieves 97%+ accuracy on invoice field extraction across all vendor formats. Complex invoices with unusual layouts may occasionally need manual review, which the system automatically flags with a confidence score.

### Q: Do you offer discounts for non-profits?
**A**: Yes! We offer 20% discount for registered non-profit organizations. Contact sales for details.

### Q: Can I integrate with accounting systems other than Sage?
**A**: Enterprise plans support custom integrations. We're also adding QuickBooks and Xero support in Q2 2026.

### Q: What if my invoice volume fluctuates seasonally?
**A**: The overage system handles this naturally. Choose a plan based on your average monthly volume. During peak months, overages cover the excess — and you only pay for what you use over the limit. No need to upgrade for temporary spikes.

### Q: How is the overage calculated?
**A**: At the end of each month, we count total invoices processed. If the count exceeds your plan limit, each additional invoice is billed at your tier's overage rate. Example: Business plan (10,000 limit) with 10,800 invoices processed = 800 × $0.10 = $80 overage.
